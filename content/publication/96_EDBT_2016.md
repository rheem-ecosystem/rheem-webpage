The world is fast moving towards a data-driven society where data is the most valuable asset. Organizations need to perform very di- verse analytic tasks using various data processing platforms. In doing so, they face many challenges; chiefly, platform dependence, poor interoperability, and poor performance when using multiple platforms. We present RHEEM, our vision for big data analytics over diverse data processing platforms. RHEEM provides a three- layer data processing and storage abstraction to achieve both plat- form independence and interoperability across multiple platforms. In this paper, we discuss our vision as well as present multiple re- search challenges that we need to address to achieve it. As a case in point, we present a data cleaning application built using some of the ideas of RHEEM. We show how it achieves platform independence and the performance benefits of following such an approach.
