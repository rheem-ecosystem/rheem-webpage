Bored of keep moving your app to the newest data processing platform to achieve high performance? Tired of dealing with a zoo of processing platforms to get the best performance for your analytic tasks? Then, this tutorial is for you!
Indeed, we are witnessing a plethora of innovative data processing platforms in the last few years. While this is generally great, leveraging these new technologies in practice bears quite some challenges, just to name a few, developers must: (i) find among the plethora of processing platforms the best one for their applications; (ii) migrate their appli- cations to newer and faster platforms every now and then; and (iii) orchestrate different platforms so that applications leverage their individual benefits.
We address these issues with Rheem, a system that en- ables big data analytics over multiple data processing plat- forms in a seamless manner. It provides a three-layer data processing abstraction with that applications can achieve both platform independence and interoperability across mul- tiple platforms. With Rheem, dRheemers (Rheem devel- opers) can focus on the logics of their applications. Rheem, in turn, takes care of efficiently executing applications by choosing either a single or multiple processing platforms. To achieve this, it comes with a cross-platform optimizer that allows a single task to run faster over multiple platforms than on a single platform.
