Many emerging applications, from domains such as health- care and oil & gas, require several data processing systems for complex analytics. This demo paper showcases Rheem, a framework that provides multi-platform task execution for such applications. It features a three-layer data process- ing abstraction and a new query optimization approach for multi-platform settings. We will demonstrate the strengths of Rheem by using real-world scenarios from three diâ†µerent applications, namely, machine learning, data cleaning, and data fusion.
