  RHEEM has a three-layer data processing abstraction that sits between user applications and data processing platforms, such as Hadoop and Spark. The figure below depicts the Rheem architecture: (i) an application layer that models all application-specific logic; (ii) a core layer that provides the intermediate representation between applications and processing platforms; and (iii) a platform layer that embraces the underlying processing platforms. Overall, the input of an application layer comprises the logical operators provided by users (or generated by a declarative query parser) and the output is a physical plan (RheemPlan). The RheemPlan is then passed to the core layer where cross-platform optimizations take place to produce an execution plan (ExecutionPlan).<br><br>
  Notice that, in contrast to DBMSs, RHEEM decouples physical and execution levels. This separation allows applications to express physical plans in terms of algorithmic needs only, without being tied to a particular processing platform. The salient features of Rheem are cross-platform task execution, high-performance, flexibility, and ease-of-use.
